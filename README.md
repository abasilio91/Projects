# Project - Parameter estimation of the thermal decomposition of biomass using DE algorithm.

compilation of the numerical project that I was involved during me graduation. The files is about the thermal decomposition under a heating rate of 5 K/min. There are, also, the heating rates of 10 K/min, 20 K/min and 30 K/min. Only the 5 K/min was translated to English, since the only major diference between the programs is the heating rate. 

1) Extract the "MC carpel 5 H-min.xls" file from the *.rar file with same name
2) execute file loaddata.m first
3) execute file inverse.m to run the main program. No changes are necessary in the remaning files.
